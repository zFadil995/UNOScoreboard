Abstract

UNO Scoreboard app is an Android app that allows user to choose one of the available game modes and select a desired number of players, and after that, automatically show scores for each player thought one game session.

Purpose

Google Play Store contains many similar apps, neither of which is easily understandable or looks well. All of them are obviously just a lame attempt at an app and provide no real solution to the needs of players.
	This app aims to rectify that by providing a non-intrusive way to help users play card games freely while not wasting any time to write down, calculate and keep track of scores. 

Features

Scoreboard App is a rather simple, neatly designed app that help users keep score of card games. It will contain newest Android features and be made with Material Design in mind.
	The app will provide the user with multiple game mode, including but not exclusive to count-down and regular counting mode, and provide up to the maximum number of players recommended for the chosen game mode.
	After that the app will open a List/Table View of all players with all their scores as well as a live sum of all their scores for easy visibility and understanding. The addition of new rounds will be as easy as clicking a button and will also enable the user to enter the cards left in hand as well as the actual sum of all the cards in hand.
	The app will also give the user the option to ignore players after they lost or keep them in game, as well as always informing players on whose turn it is to deal cards.

Price

The app itself will be free with no intention of including advertisements, but might include the option to support the developer. The purpose of this app is not to gain financial benefit, but to be a representation of said developerâ€™s capabilities.
